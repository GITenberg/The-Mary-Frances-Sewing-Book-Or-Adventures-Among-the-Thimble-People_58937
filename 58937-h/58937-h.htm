<blockquote>
<p>The Mary Frances Cook Book is the exceptionally
clever and fascinating story of a little girl who wanted to
learn to help her mother. Only it is much more than a
story. It tells in story form how Mary Frances learned
to cook. She wants to know what all the kitchen pots
and pans are for, so she asks them. And they tell her―the
pots and pans talk. The book gives recipes in the
simplest, plainest words. It describes every operation
clearly―just what Mary Frances did, and how she learned
to avoid mistakes. The book stimulates the imagination
and creates a desire to follow Mary Frances’ example.
8vo. Cloth, 170 pages. Over 200 colored illustrations
by Margaret G. Hays and Jane Allen Boyer.</p>

<p class="center smcap xxlarge">PREFACE</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dear Girls</span>:</p>

 <p class="p3">Many of you already know Mary Frances’ old friends,
the Kitchen People, and have learned to love them. I
hope all of you will do so in time.</p>

 <p class="p3">This book tells the story of Mary Frances’ new friends,
the Thimble People, who helped her spend a delightful
summer vacation at her Grandmother’s. It tells how she
met Sewing Bird, who was a real Fairy Lady, and the
other Thimble People; and how they taught her a lot of
fascinating secrets, and finally took her on a long
journey to Thimble Land, and brought her back safely,
after the most marvelous adventures. Because they
proved so helpful and friendly, she wants you to know
them, too.</p>

 <p class="p3">The Thimble People, like the Kitchen People, are
peculiar in that they can be of little help to those who
dislike them; so that, unless you are prepared to be
fond of them, it is best not to seek their acquaintance.</p>

 <p>Mary Frances looked at the canary; but
Dick was very busily preening his feathers,
and Dick seldom sang.</p>

 <p>“Cheer up!” gurgled again the sweet bird voice.</p>

 <p>Mary Frances was certain this time that it was
not Dick.</p>

 <p>Maybe it was a bird outside!</p>

 <p>She looked out of the sewing-room window. No,
not a single feather was in sight. All the birds were
doubtless in their little nests, or hiding close in the
barn to keep themselves warm in such a rain.</p>

 <p>“Dick!” said Mary Frances, “Dick, did you
speak?”</p>

 <p>Dick only ducked his head again for a seed, and
snapped off the shell with his strong little bill.</p>

 <p>“Peep! Peep! Peep!” sang a bird’s voice, as though
inviting Mary Frances to a game.</p>

 <p>“I’ll play ‘Hide and Seek,’” thought the little girl.</p>

 <p>“Where are you, Birdie?” she asked aloud; and,
throwing Angie on the rocking chair, began to search.</p>

 <p>Another soft little “Peep!” drew her near her
grandmother’s work-basket.</p>

 <p>“Why!” she cried, “I could easily believe the voice
comes from Grandma’s basket!”</p>

 <p>“Peep! Peep! Peep! Peep!” the bird voice answered
excitedly, as Mary Frances leaned over.</p>

 <p>“Why! Why! Why!” she exclaimed. “If it
isn’t―if it isn’t Grandma’s Sewing Bird! You dear
little thing! Can you talk, too?” lifting her out. “I never
thought of you!”</p>

 <p>“Do you remember the overhanding stitch on canvas?
Yes? Now, those little ends of the bag above
the running stitches, are to be overhanded together.
You put the needle in straighter, and more toward
you―like this,” as she placed the needle in position.</p>

 <p>“Now fold the two hemmed ends together, the right
sides facing each other.</p>

 <p>“Baste along the longer edges with even basting.
Overhand these edges together.</p>

 <p>“You would not always overhand the sides of a bag
together,―you could run it, or back-stitch, or combination
stitch it; but we want this unusually strong because
your dolly will have so many clothes to be stuffed
into it. I should say handkerchiefs, because this
bag is really a handkerchief bag, or a <i>little</i> laundry
bag.”</p>

 <p>“My, how well you have done this side. Let me
touch the other side with my bodkin wand―there!”

easily,” lectured Thimble. “No in-sub-or-din-a-tion!
Stop and think! You know my family’s power,―you
know my family’s wealth. You realize, I hope, you
live in a land named for my aris-to-crat-ic ancestors―Thimble
Land!”</p>

 <p>“Oh, ancestors go-to-China!” exclaimed Emery
Bag. “We live in the present, and I demand―I demand

Thimble. “What you sticking your ’pinion in for?
It’s a wonder Sewing Bird hasn’t stuck her bill in!
Tommy Pin Cushion, you might just as well keep out
of this―everybody knows you’re stuck on yourself―Fatty!”</p>

voice of Pin Cushion. “You will please address me

what’s more, if you don’t quickly remove all those needles
from poor Emery, you won’t get any more sword-needles to wield.
So there! You know Sewing Bird’s taking forty
winks; that’s why you don’t act in your best military
manner.”</p>

 <p>Silver Thimble looked toward Sewing Bird, whose
eyes began to open, and quickly went toward Emery Bag.

to Pin Cushion and quilted each into its place.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
 <p>Cotton cloth is made from the cotton plant; wool cloth from
sheep’s fleece; silk cloth from silk worm’s cocoon; linen cloth
from the flax plant.</p>

 <p>The soft cotton is the warm coat for the cotton plant seed-baby.
The fleecy wool is the warm coat of the sheep, or the little
lambs. The web from the silk worm’s cocoon is the cradle in
which it sleeps. Linen is made from the stalks of the flax plant.</p>

 <p>When these materials are spun, or twisted, into long threads,
we have spool cotton and silk, wool yarns, and linen thread, for
sewing. When the threads are woven or laced together into
cloth, the stronger threads run the length of the goods―they are
the warp threads. The weaker, or woof threads, run crosswise of
the goods.</p>

quite-a-bit finer working cotton, in pink,―isn’t it
pretty?”</p>

“Now, little Miss, see if you can make that stitch on
muslin.”</p>

 <p>“Mary Frances! Mary Frances! Mary Frances!”
came Grandma’s voice from the hall.</p>

 <p>With one leap, Fairy Lady changed to Sewing
Bird, and all the other Thimble People, who had been
standing on the sewing table, tumbled head-over-tin-cups
into the sewing basket.</p>

 <p>“Yes, Grandma,” called Mary Frances, running out.</p>

 <p>“Why, my dear,” puffed the old lady, climbing
the last of the stairs, “I am home very early, you
see. There was no regular meeting to-day because
almost all the members of the Ladies’ Guild went to
Daisy’s wedding. I’m home for some games with my
little girl.”</p>

 <p>“Oh, Nanny-dear, will you play ‛Piddy-Pinny-Plump?’”
asked Mary Frances.</p>

 <p>“A telegram for Miss Mary Frances,”
said Katie coming into the dining-room.</p>

 <p>“A telegram! And for you, Mary Frances. What
can it be!” exclaimed Grandma.</p>

 <p>“Shall I sign for it, ma’am?” asked Katie.</p>

 <p>“No,” said Grandma. “Mary Frances better learn
to sign for herself.”</p>

 <p>There was a little look of excitement in Grandma’s
face, and a little pink spot in each cheek.</p>

 <p>Trembling with wonder, Mary Frances gravely
wrote her name in the book. She opened the queer
looking envelope, with printing almost all over its
face, and read:</p>

<blockquote>

 <p>“Your Father meant that to reach here before

 <p>“San Francisco is so far off,” said Mary Frances;

 <p>Katie was as delighted as Mary Frances.</p>

 <p>“Katie is a wonder, Nanny,” said Mary Frances.
“She was telling me yesterday about all she could do
when she was little. When she was a mere child she
could cook a pair of pork chops beautifully, she told
me.”</p>

Josie Worrell and his horse plow our garden, I went
out and patted the horse’s nose. He was so pleased,
you should have seen him wag his tail.”</p>

 <p>Grandma laughed again. “You have a dear,

Frances by the hand, went out on the veranda.</p>

the big package from the expressman. “Nanny, I can

 <p>“We’ll have you out of the dark box soon, Mary
Marie, dear,” she whispered through an opening in
the wrapping paper.</p>

I’ll bring the dolly for you to see, Nanny, dear, soon as
she’s unpacked.”</p>

to her! Oh, there she is! Isn’t she a darling, Katie!
And look, here’s her trunk!”</p>

 <p>Surely Mary Marie was a lovely doll. She had
beautiful long curls tied with pink ribbon; and on her
feet were short stockings and slippers,―but her dress
was a very plain, simple, “slip” of lawn.</p>

 <p>There was a note pinned on Mary Marie’s dress,
and a little key. The note read:</p>

<blockquote>

 <p><i>Dear Scout</i>:</p>

 <p><i>Please read my letter in the tray of Mary Marie’s
trunk before unpacking. Here is the key.</i></p>

 <p>“What lovely long eye-lashes,” whispered Mary

 <p>After showing the dolly to Grandma, she unlocked

very doll I’ve been looking for, for my own dear daughter.
Father has told you something about Mary Marie, but
I want to add some particulars.</i></p>

 <p><i>I have nothing to say about the care of her,―for I
know my little girl’s careful, neat ways so well. You
may be surprised when you unpack her trunk, to find no
dresses. Mother is sending you, instead, all kinds of
pretty goods which you may make up into dresses and
clothes for your new little daughter; and you will find all
kinds of laces and ribbons, and buttons, and hooks and
eyes―everything Mother could think Mary Frances or
Mary Marie could possibly want.</i></p>

“that Dresden figured, pink and blue, inch wide ribbon
is beautiful, and there must be about a yard and
three-quarters of it.”</p>

 <p>“Lovely!” exclaimed Mary Frances, putting it
with the flannel on the table. “Now, I’ll cut out the

 <p>“Very important! Very important!” whispered
Tommy Pin Cushion as Scissors Shears came dancing,
first on one leg and then on the other, to the edge of

Shears, looking cross-eyed at Tommy Pin Cushion,
“I’ve too much to go through,” glancing up to see if
Mary Frances noticed; but the little girl was smoothing
out and pinning the pattern in place, and did not
seem to hear.</p>

Frances cut into the thick fabric.</p>

 <p>3. Stitch, or use combination stitch (two running stitches
and a back-stitch).</p>

 <p>4. Overcast, or blanket-stitch the raw edges of the seams.</p>

 <p>5. Fold inch wide ribbon, and slip it over the raw edges of the
bath robe―that is, the fronts and neck, and the sleeves.</p>

 <p>6. To fit ribbon around curves, gather it a short distance on
the fuller edge.</p>

 <p>When ready to cut ribbon, allow one-half inch for folding
under when finishing.</p>

 <p>Hem ends down carefully.</p>

 <p>7. With sewing silk to match the ribbon, sew it to the robe,
with small “in and out” stitches, slanting the needle slightly
each time. Pull needle through to wrong side, then through to right
side with each stitch―just as you did first stitches in canvas work.</p>

 <p>8. Turn bottom of robe up one inch. Baste.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sun shone brightly into the sewing-room;
everything was neatly in place. Sewing Bird
was sitting on her perch on the sewing table.
Mary Frances’ work basket was at one end.</p>

Sewing<br />Bird<br />on her<br />perch</div>

 <p>That is the way things looked as Mary Frances
peeped in the door to see what the Thimble People
might be doing.</p>

 <p>She was just about to enter, when she saw a little
fluttering in the work basket.</p>

 <p>“Oh, I do hope they’ll have some fun,” she thought.</p>

 <p>Over the edge of the basket peeped the bright little
eyes of Silver Thimble. Then he tumbled out on the
sewing table.</p>

 <p>“Why didn’t you step over, Silv?” asked Scissors
Shears, stepping over the side of the basket.</p>

 <p>“I’ll take steps to find out why,” said Tommy
Pin Cushion, rolling over the side.</p>

 <p>“You’ll take steps! Impossible!” exclaimed Emery Bag. “Why, Fatty,
I could get out of the basket as easily as that myself!” And out he
jumped.</p>

“Ah, I’ve<br />always<br />been<br />lead!”</div>

 <p>Then out came Pen Cil, carrying a little piece of
paper.</p>

 <p>“What’s that for?” asked Silver Thimble, pointing
to the paper.</p>

 <p>“What do you ’spose, Tinkle?” he asked, loftily
looking down upon the little fellow―“to write on.”</p>

 <p>“Oh, I ought to have known,” snickered Silver
Thimble. “You always do write!”</p>

 <p>“I am the only one of you who does, though,”
and Pen Cil hopped on his one leg to the other end of
the table. Jumping up and down, he began:</p>

 <p>“All ready for the grand presentation? Let’s
practice!”</p>

 <p>“Not so fast! Not so fast! Mr. Pen Cil,” exclaimed
Needle Book. “I lead!”</p>

 <p>“Oh, beg your pardon,” said Pen Cil. “I forgot!
I’m lead―ah, I’ve always been lead,” sighing.</p>

 <p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Tommy Pin Cushion, “tied
to his miss’s apron-strings!”</p>

 <p>“But where are the rest of us?” called out Scissors
Shears.</p>

 <p>With that, out sprang all the needles and pins―even
a few safety pins Mary Frances had put in one
corner of her work box; all the buttons, and all the
other little findings; so many, Mary Frances couldn’t
see where they came from.</p>

 <p>All button-holes should be worked in a double fold of cloth.
Use for practice, a piece of muslin six inches long and four inches
wide. Fold through the center. Turn in and baste along edges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="center">(A) <i>To Cut</i></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>With button-hole scissors, cut into the goods one quarter
of an inch from folded edge. Cut along a thread of the goods to
make it straight. Make opening a little longer than the button
is broad. For button-hole, use No. 40 cotton, No. 8 needle.
Barring and overcasting are often done with a finer thread than
that used for the button-holing.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>1. Make a small knot in thread.</p>

 <p>2. Put the goods over first finger, left hand―folded edge
toward you.</p>

 <p>3. At the end of button-hole farthest from folded edge of
cloth, insert needle between the double cloth, bringing it out at
A. (See picture.)</p>

 <p>4. Point needle down at B; bring it out at A.</p>

 <p>5. Point needle down at C; bring it out at D. Do this twice.</p>

 <p>1. With goods over forefinger of left hand, at end of button-hole
farthest from the folded edge of the cloth, insert needle
between the muslin; pull through, leaving a small end of thread
between muslin.</p>

 <p>2. At same corner of button-hole, bring needle half way
through. Taking both threads hanging from eye of needle between
thumb and finger of right hand, pass the thread <i>under</i> the point
of the needle, from right to left. Pull needle through, drawing
the thread firmly near the button-hole. This forms the purl,
which is well adapted to the constant wear upon the button-hole.</p>

blanket or loop stitch,―make several loop stitches and bring
needle to wrong side.</p>

 <p>3. Fasten thread by several small stitches.</p>

 <p>NOTE.―If thread is too short to finish button-holing, fasten it
on wrong side of material. Enter the new thread on wrong side and
bring thread through last button-hole purl, or twisted edge.</p>

make Angie a lot of clothes like Mary Marie’s.”</p>

 <p>“Will the Old Grunt be back?” Scissors Shears
was looking up at Mary Frances.</p>

 <p>“Who?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

 <p>“The Old Grunt,” said Scissors Shears, “fussin’
and gruntin’ over everything. We looked all right.
She scared us―if we hadn’t dropped where we were
she might have found out about us―and if she’d found
out about us―we’d been Never-Nevers.”</p>

 <p>“You must not call names,” said Mary Frances,
gravely.</p>

 <p>“She is an Old Grunt! So there! It was my work
to teach you to make button-holes, and I so wanted
to do it!” burst out Button-hole Scissors, excitedly.</p>

 <p>He spread his funny little legs apart and looked up
at Mary Frances most forlornly.</p>

 <p>“Rip-her-up-the-back! Butty,” growled Scissors
Shears.</p>

than any of you others can.”</p>

 <p>“Ha!” laughed Tommy Pin Cushion, “but not
love her better.”</p>

 <p>“The dear things!” thought Mary Frances, “and
I was going to run away! What can a flannel pet be?
Is it a flannel cat, or rabbit, or dog?”</p>

 <p>“Mary Frances!” called Grandma.</p>

 <p>“Listen, Nanny,” said the little girl leaning over
the banister, “will you feel much disappointed, dear
Nanny, if I don’t go? I―I―”</p>

 <p>“Why, no, my child!” said Grandma. Mrs. Bennett
is going with me, so I’ll have company, but I
thought you’d be lonely. Good-bye, dear,―take a
nap if you feel like it.”</p>

 <p>“Good-bye, Nanny dear,” smiled Mary Frances,
throwing the old lady a kiss. “She really does spoil
me, I fear,” she thought. “I never had my own way
so exactly before.”</p>

 <p>NOTE.―To learn to make a fell, use two pieces of flannel,
each six inches long, and three inches wide. Practise with these,
before attempting the fell on the petticoat.</p>

one-eighth of an inch beyond the other.</p>

seam with wider side covering the narrower. Do not open it.</p>

but leave it open, and baste down flat after pressing.</p>

weighed nothing. Her nose felt strange, and she
thought she ought to find her handkerchief.</p>

started to find her pocket. Imagine her surprise
when she couldn’t find her hand.</p>

 <p>“Why, where can it be?” she thought. “I’ll see
if I can move my arm!”</p>

 <p>She raised one arm, and then the other, and away
she flew. Out the window―and across the blue sky―she,
nearly as blue as the sky itself, if she had
known it.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
